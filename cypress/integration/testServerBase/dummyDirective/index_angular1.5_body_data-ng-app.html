      This is an application with a defined directive called <div class="quoted-text">< dummy-directive /></div>

      This will be removed in tests, since body contents are removed after compiling the tested directive.

      The following directive changes the state of the application.
      Later on, we will check the the state is reset.

      <stateful-directive></stateful-directive>
    </div>
